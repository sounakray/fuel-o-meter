# Fuel-O-Meter #

It is a compact MIDlet application that resides on your phone and accompanies you wherever you go, giving you the most crucial statistics of your vehicle's mileage performance. The objective of this application is to keep the data entry part at its minimum while providing you the maximum information - right when you need it - presented exactly in the way you want it!


This application is targeted to run on all J2ME devices, with CLDC 1.0 and MIDP 2.0 configurations. It's optimized for the lightest memory footprint, and minimal data hits.

The project is still in its initial phase of its development.
